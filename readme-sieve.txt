Contribute and tribute to the sieve of eratosthenes algorithm and the
Postscript programming language, This little piece of code generate an
early range of prime number.

This code is in public domain.


Usage:
This code is intended to be used on linux boxes and with interactive
Postscript interpreters.

1. Download Ghostscript.

2. Download source code.

3. run:
user@machine>gs -sDEVICE=nullpage sieve-of-eratosthenes.ps

You type in the maximum of the range, 60000 is the limit for
Ghostscript, and you will and an array of all the primes.
